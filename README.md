# Persistent World Network

Persistent World Network is a proposed suite of open-source software for use in the development and deployment of persistent open-world multiplayer experiences. This is not intended to be an all-purpose "game engine", rather a narrowly-focused effort to close some of the tooling gap that seems to exist in the game development industry. 

Requirements:
- Low-latency multiplayer netcode
- server-side physics and projectiles with smooth client-side prediction
- Open-world traversal across connected zone servers
- Data transfer across servers
- Persistent world state that can be manipulated by users
- Persistent user state between sessions
- User auth
- Developer API
